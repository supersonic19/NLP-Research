We don't do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs
Do the same drugs no more
'Cause she don't do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs
Do the same drugs no more


I smoke two joints in the morning,
I smoke two joints at night,
I smoke two joints in the afternoon,
It makes me feel all right.
I smoke two joints in time of peace,
And two in time of war.
I smoke two joints before I smoke two joints,
And then I smoke two more.
Smoked cigarettes 'til the day she died
Toke a big spliff of some good sensimillia
Smoked cigarettes 'til the day she died
Toke a big spliff of some good sensamill...
Easy E were ya ever caught slippin'?
Hell no!


Smokin Smokin Weed
Havin a party (Bring the weed)
I got my lighter (Got a blunt)

I got an ashtray (at my place)
Where did my pipe go?


Too low in my life
Gotta stay high, gotta stay high


I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner (I'm a stoner)

Got bitches 'n marijuana


Yeah, g-shit, and I ain't smokin none of dat unless the weed stick
Crumblin the herb and rollin it up in the swishers
Kush is my cologne, every minute blowin heavy
I don't smoke it on occasion, everyday is 4/20
All I do is flame shit, I don't do that change shit
EST for life bitch, ya I do that gang shit
Look at who I came with, better fix ya face quick
Cause I gotta lot of muh-fuckers with me we all on the same shit
Now pass me the dutch again, I still gotta nickle crumbled in the george washington
Order up a quarter my connect is on the phone
Mix the purple with the lemon g kush and get stoned


After that is when the purple smoke billows up and hazes
Drinkin, smokin, now I got the spins like a merry-go


I took a shot of cocaine and I shot my woman down
Took a shot of cocaine and away I run
Late in the hot joints takin' the pills


I need you more than dope
Need you more than dope
Need you more than dope
I need you more than dope


All i could see is a bunch of smoke flyin'
And I'm so high that I might die if I go by it
These drugs really gotta hold on me


Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo, sippin' on gin and juice
So we gon' smoke a ounce to this












I catch em while they coked up and weeded.


My momma said don't be that, the little nigga that sell crack.
